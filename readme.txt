A filter for WordPress to insert div tags easily, useful if your're using a WYSIWYG- or any other RichtText editor.

== Description ==

**pb-easyDiv** is filter to insert `<div>` tags easily, useful if your're using a WYSIWYG- or any other RichtText editor.

To create a `<div>` in your posts easily, please use the following code: `[div]CONTENT[/div]`

Well, a simple `<div>` would be quite senseless without attributes assigned to it, so you would like to use the following code: `[div ATTRIBUTES]CONTENT[/div]` 
Example: `[div class="whatyouwanthere" id="DivID" title="MyDiv"]CONTENT[/div]`

== Installation ==

Place `wp-pb-easyDiv.php` into your plugins directory (*wp-content/plugins/*) and activate it in your admin panel.
